🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using various machine learning algorithms. It uses historical data of car features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more to provide accurate price estimations. This can help individuals and dealers make informed buying or selling decisions.
